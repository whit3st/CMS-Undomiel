This is a custom CMS solution for Astro.js Content Collections. Idea is to have a single place for all of your Astro websites and content and manage them in one place without creating CMS's for each project.
In this project, I have only used Octokit.js, official GitHub API library and that is all. This project does NOT collect and store any of your data. All the data needed is stored on your local browser storage known as localStorage.

## This project is still work in progress. Some functionalities have not yet been implemented.
## Please DO NOT use this project on production code since it is not ready.

### This project will ask for your permission to read and write to your both public and private repos.
